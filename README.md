# Weather-Dashboard
My challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. Use the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data for cities. The documentation includes a section called "How to start" that provides basic setup and usage instructions. You will use localStorage to store any persistent data.
